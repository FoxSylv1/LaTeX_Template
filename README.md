# A LaTeX template for classwork.

To set up the header, add the class information
under the section labeled by `%DOCUMENT INFO`

To add problems, add their number by using `item`s 
labels in the `enumerate` environment under `%DOCUMENT 
DATA`, and use the list elements themselves to write the solutions.
